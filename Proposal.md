## Description
  I plan to create create a chess game that can be played between 2 computers over a network.
## Interface
- One person will start the game and be joined by the other player
- The game will initially be developed as a command line game with ASCII graphics and requiring text user input, but may later be given graphics
## Technical Design
### Topics Covered In Class
  - Networking: Computers will communicate over a networ
  - Processes: The server process will be seperate from the 2 client processes
  - Semaphores: Semaphores will be used to communicate whose turn it is
  - Working With Files: Stats will be saved in a file
  - Shared memory: Will be used to store the current game 
### Data structures / Algorithms
  - Structs: Will be heavily utilized for various parts of the game such as pieces and the board
  - Arrays: Will also be heavily used, for example to hold the pieces
  - Chess rules: Will have to be programmed in. I think that counts as an algorithm?
## Expected Timeline
### KNOWNS
  - I have NEVER been correct about the timeline for a project. Hofstadter’s Law, if you’ve never heard it, states: “It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.”
  - It will DEFINITELY be finished before "Friday 1/17, 8am".
### Just Spitballing Here, Don't Quote Me On It ...
- [x] Jan  6,2020 Basic structs and relationships between them created
- [x] Jan 10, 2020 Game rules and move eligibility checking set up
- [x] Jan 14, 2020 Hopefully I'll figure out how networks work by then
- [x] Jan 16, 2020 All ~~bugs~~ surprise features should have been ~~fixed~~ postponed for a later release.
- [x] Jan 17, 2020, (Pre-8AM) maybe I'll have time to try and add graphics
- [ ] Jan 17, 2020, (Seconds to spare until 8AM) Submitted!
